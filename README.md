BackboneMVC
===========

* Based on Backbone.
* This is a CakePHP-like controllers and url routing framework, but it is for the web front-end.
* Automatic url <-> controller actions mapping
* Asynchronous controller actions invocation
* Singleton controllers
* Automatic session checking before invoking session sensitive controller actions
* CakePHP-like event hooks: beforeFilter, afterRender etc.

Examples
========
 There are some examples under /example/ :
* _requirejs_ shows how to port BackboneMVC to your project with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)
* _scaffold_ shows a regular way of organizing your application using BackboneMVC.
